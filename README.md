# node-chat-app

https://privatenostorage.herokuapp.com/ <-- currently deployed on heroku

This app currently has no backend, so none of the messages are stored.
The concept is to create a messaging app that eventually is completely private and crypted while the conversation goes on
and once the users leave the conversation, the data is erased or over written with blank data.

Currently: Rooms are case sensitive, multiple users can enter with the same name and the conversations are open to everyone without a password to the room

          Current Stack: NodeJS, Express, MustacheJS and basic HTML, CSS5

Future Implementation: fix the bugs and improve security, add a database and bcrypt passwords for rooms

          Future Stack: NodeJS, Express, VueJS, MongoDB
